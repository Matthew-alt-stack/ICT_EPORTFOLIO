<font size="5"> My reflection this 1st quarter: Coding was always interesting for me. It's fun to know that coding is the foundation and 
structure of all the website.It gives me chills because coding seems so fun to do. The first 3 lessons were pretty cool. The hands-on was
easy, but it seems so fast-paced. We always have to rush, and it puts a lot of pressure. We also weren't able to code much during ICT because 
of the short amount of time so we try our best to learn on are own. This 1st quarter seems very fast, and we didn't really get the chance
to code more. The quizzes, on the other hand, seem pretty easy but hard at the same time. Our first lesson was XHTML. It was pretty easy, 
and it makes me recall some of my coding experience last year. This lesson helped me become more precise and exact in writing codes. The list and 
tables, on the other hand, were pretty easy, but the hands-on were pretty quick and I wasn't experience in writing code that is base on browser
output. I learned how to picture the output of the code better than before, and it really helped me recall my past knowledge in HTML, heading, body tag
font tag and many more. I learned how to use other attributes, and I learned some shortcuts that can be useful. Although I didn't finish the hands-on, 
I'm still glad that I learned a lot and did my best on it. Hyperlinks and forms, on the other hand, became so confusing. The lesson became so
hard that I lost track of what we were actually discussing. I learned how all this is necessary, and I was happy after  I finally did the correct 
code. The codes here were so fun and interesting since I didn't know that it was going to be so easy. This last 2 lessons made me more curious 
about ICT coding and what more I can do. Overall, this lesson was pretty awesome, and I can safely say that I learned a lot in it.  I 
learned how to make a good structure in HTML, and I learned how important it is to have a correct input in coding. I also learned where to 
look when the code doesn't work. The lessons made me curious and love ICT more. It made me become knowledgeable about coding and made me 
code faster. Thanks, Ms. Uminga, for being the best teacher who teaches coherently and is always understanding of her students. 
Thank you, and I am excited for the surprises next quarter. I learned how to code list, tables, hyperlink and forms. I also learned 
a lot of different types of it and different attributes for it.</font> </font>
